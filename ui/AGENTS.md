## CRITICAL RULES - NON-NEGOTIABLE

### React

- ALWAYS: `import { useState, useEffect } from "react"`
- NEVER: `import React`, `import * as React`, `import React as *`
- NEVER: `useMemo`, `useCallback` (React Compiler handles optimization)

### Types

- ALWAYS: `const X = { A: "a", B: "b" } as const; type T = typeof X[keyof typeof X]`
- NEVER: `type T = "a" | "b"`

### Interfaces

- ALWAYS: One level depth only; object property → dedicated interface (recursive)
- ALWAYS: Reuse via `extends`
- NEVER: Inline nested objects

### Styling

- Single class: `className="bg-slate-800 text-white"`
- Merge multiple classes: `className={cn(BASE_STYLES, variant && "variant-class")}`
- Dynamic values: `style={{ width: "50%" }}`
- NEVER: `var()` in className, hex colors

### Scope Rule (ABSOLUTE)

- Used 2+ places → `lib/` or `types/` or `hooks/` (components go in `components/{domain}/`)
- Used 1 place → keep local in feature directory
- This determines ALL folder structure decisions

## DECISION TREES

### Component Placement

```
New/Existing UI? → shadcn/ui + Tailwind
Used 1 feature? → features/{feature}/components | Used 2+? → components/{domain}/
Needs state/hooks? → "use client" | Server component? → No directive
```

### Code Location

```
Server action → actions/{feature}/{feature}.ts
Data transform → actions/{feature}/{feature}.adapter.ts
Types (shared 2+) → types/{domain}.ts | Types (local 1) → {feature}/types.ts
Utils (shared 2+) → lib/ | Utils (local 1) → {feature}/utils/
Hooks (shared 2+) → hooks/ | Hooks (local 1) → {feature}/hooks.ts
shadcn components → components/shadcn/
```

## TECH STACK

Next.js 16 | React 19 | Tailwind 4 | shadcn/ui
Zod 4 | React Hook Form | Zustand 5 | NextAuth | Recharts
